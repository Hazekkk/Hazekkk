ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I created this script with the aim of improving knowledge. Any help or corrections to the code will be of great help.

- Download the necessary libraries:

Firstly you will need the readline library so that the script can interact with the user through the terminal (cmd).

```
npm install readline
```

Next you will need the axios library.

```
npm install axios
```
