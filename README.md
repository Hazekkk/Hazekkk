ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I created this script with the aim of improving knowledge. Any help or corrections to the code will be of great help.

## Instructions for use

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. **Installing the necessary libraries**:

   First, you will need the readline library so that the script can interact with the user through the terminal (cmd). Run the following command to install it:

   npm install readline
   ```
   
    Next you will need the axios library. Install it with the following command:
   
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```
   
3. **Running the script:**:

    Execute o script usando o seguinte comando:
